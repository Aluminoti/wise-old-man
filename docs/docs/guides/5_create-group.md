### Overview
Groups help organize players from the same clan or friends chat and allows them to compete and contribute in various group activities. This guide shows how to create a group on Wise Old Man.

### Prerequisites
- Recommended: Having an in-game clan with the same name as the group you are creating on the website will help players find your group.
- Recommended: Verify all player profiles exist (opted into tracking) so players can view their stats. See: [`/guides/how-to-start-tracking`](/guides/how-to-start-tracking)

### Steps
1. Navigate to the create page
   1. Go to Groups and select `+ Create new`, or open [`https://wiseoldman.net/groups/create`](https://wiseoldman.net/groups/create)

2. Enter information
   1. Name: Your group’s display name, preferably matching an in-game clan or friends chat.
   2. Clan chat: Your in‑game clan chat name.
   3. Homeworld: Your primary Old School RuneScape world (number).
   4. Description: A short summary of your group.
   5. Click Next.

3. Choose how to add members
   > *If you plan on using our sync feature through the RuneLite plugin, you should select the `Add players manually` option, skip adding players, and click the `Next` button - confirming an empty group. Afterwards you can sync in-game.*
   
   1. Import from file: Paste a list of usernames and verify you select the proper separation type (new line, comma, semicolon)
   2. Add players manually: Use the search to add players one by one.

4. Review and set member roles
   1. For each member, pick a role (e.g., Member, Leader) from the `Role` dropdown.
   2. Remove entries if needed.
   3. Click `Next` to create the group.
      1. If you have no members yet, you’ll be asked to confirm creating an empty group.

5. Save your verification code
   1. After creation, a verification code is shown. Save this code securely for future verification and management.
   2. You’ll then be redirected to your new group page.

### Tips
- You can edit group details later from your group page (for example, to update description or add socials).
- You can add or remove members and change roles at any time from the group management screens.
- You can sync your group from in-game if you install the `Wise Old Man` RuneLite plugin.

### Troubleshooting
- If an error appears when creating the group, read the message and correct the input (for example, invalid usernames) and try again.
