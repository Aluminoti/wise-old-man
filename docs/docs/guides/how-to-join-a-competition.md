### Overview
Competitions can be hosted by users or groups. Participating in these competitions can be a fun way to progress your account. This guide explains how participation works for both user-created and group-created competitions.

### Prerequisites
- Your player profile exists on Wise Old Man (opted into tracking). See: [`/guides/how-to-start-tracking`](/guides/how-to-start-tracking)

### Competition Types

#### User-created competitions
- Typically created for a group of friends who don't necessarily belong to the same group (clan) on the website.
- Only the host can add participants - it is not possible to view who the host is.
- There is not an on-site Join or Request to Join feature.

#### Group-created competitions
- Created by a group’s leaders/admins.
- Typically restricted to group members.
- Only group leaders can add participants (usually from their group roster).
- You may need to contact a group leader to be added.

### How to participate

1. Ensure your profile exists and is up to date
   1. If you’ve never been tracked, follow the Start Tracking guide to create your profile.
   2. Consider requesting a fresh update so the host can validate your stats.
   
2. Find an active competition
   1. Browse `https://wiseoldman.net/competitions` and filter by metric, status, and/or type.
   2. Open the competition page and read its description/rules for any listed contact info.

3. Contact the right person
   1. User-created competitions: The host isn’t identifiable on-site. Reach out where you discovered the competition (Discord, clan chat, forum post) and provide your RuneScape name and a link to your Wise Old Man profile.
   2. Group-created competitions: Contact a leader/admin of the hosting group (check the group’s page or posted socials) and ask to be added.

4. Get added by the host/leader
   1. The host/leader will add you manually. You’ll appear in the participant list when added.
   2. If team-based, specify which team you should join (if applicable).

### Tips
- Join early so organizers have time to add you before the start time.
- Keep your profile updated so organizers can verify your eligibility.
- For group competitions, joining the group may be required before being added to the competition.

### Troubleshooting
- Can’t find who to contact: For non-group competitions, the host is not listed on-site; look for contact info where the competition was announced.
- Not appearing on the page: You haven’t been added yet; confirm with the host/leader.
- Profile not found: Create your profile first by starting tracking.
