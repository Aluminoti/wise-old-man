### Overview
Competitions allow players to compare their gains against other participants for metric(s) over a specific timeframe. This guide shows how to create a competition on Wise Old Man.

### Prerequisites
- Recommended: Verify all player profiles exist (opted into tracking) so organizers/players can view your stats. See: [`/guides/how-to-start-tracking`](/guides/how-to-start-tracking)

### Steps
1. Navigate to the create page
   1. Go to `Competitions` and click `+ Create new`, or open [`https://wiseoldman.net/competitions/create`](https://wiseoldman.net/competitions/create).

2. Enter information
   1. Title: A clear name for your competition 
      1. Example: “Herblore - Skill of the Week”
   2. Metric: Choose a skill, boss, activity, or computed metric.
   3. Timezone: Pick Local timezone or UTC for how dates/times are displayed during setup.
   4. Dates and times: Set Start date/time and End date/time.

3. Select a host group (Optional)
   1. Toggle the group competition switch
   2. Search for and select the group that you have the verification code for. 
   3. Enter the verification code and click the `Next` button to proceed. 
   4. Otherwise, click `Next` to continue without a host group.

4. Choose competition type and add participants
   1. Select a type
      1. **Classic**: Add participants (you can include players from the selected group or add manually).
      2. **Team**: Create teams and assign players to each team.
   2. Click Next to create the competition.

5. Save your verification code if you did not create a group competition
> *The verification code provided when making a non-group competition can be used to edit the competition in the future.
> For group competitions, you can use the group verification code to edit group competitions after they are created.*

   1. After creation of a non-group competition, a verification code is shown. 
   2. Save this code securely for future management.
   3. You’ll be redirected to the competition page.

### Tips
- You can preview a competition under a different metric - removing the need to create multiple competitions for things like godwars.
- Hosting under a group allows group visibility/association.

### Troubleshooting
- If an error appears on creation, read the message, adjust inputs (e.g., missing verification code for hosting group), and try again.
