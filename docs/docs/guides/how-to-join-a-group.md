### Overview
Players have profiles created by opting into tracking. These profiles can be added to a group, typically representing an in-game clan. This guide explains how to get added to a group on Wise Old Man.

### Prerequisites
- Your player profile exists on Wise Old Man (opted into tracking). See: [`/guides/how-to-start-tracking`](/guides/how-to-start-tracking)

### How group membership works
- Groups are maintained by their leaders/admins.
- Players can only be added/removed from a group by someone with a verification code.

### Steps to get added to a group
1. Ensure your profile exists and is up to date
   1. If you’ve never been tracked, follow the Start Tracking guide to create your profile.
   2. Consider requesting a fresh update so leaders can validate your stats since some groups have level and killcount requirements in order to join.

2. Find the group
   1. Browse [`https://wiseoldman.net/groups`](https://wiseoldman.net/groups) or navigate directly if you have the link.
   2. Review the group’s page for description and any listed socials.

3. Contact a group leader/admin
   1. Reach out in-game, Discord, or wherever the group organizes.
   2. The leader/admin may request your WOM profile or screenshots in order to verify you meet their requirements.

4. Get added by the leader/admin
   1. A leader/admin will add you manually to the group.
   2. Once added, you’ll appear as a member on the group page.

### After you’re added
- Leaders/admins may assign you a role that corresponds to your in-game clan.
- You’ll be able to participate in the group’s competitions and appear in group stats and leaderboards.

### Tips
- Keep your profile updated so leaders can verify your identity and stats quickly.
- If you don’t know who the leaders are, check the group’s socials or ask in their clan chat/Discord.
- Be patient - leaders add members manually and may be in a different timezone.

### Troubleshooting
- Can’t find contact info: Most clans will add their socials to the group page. If they have not, you may need to reach out directly and ask how to join.
- I've joined an in-game clan but am not in the WOM group: Contact the group leader and ask if they can add you the group.
