### Overview
Competitions can be hosted by users or groups. Participating in these competitions can be a fun way to progress your account. This guide explains how participation works for both user-created and group-created competitions.

### Prerequisites
- Your player profile exists on Wise Old Man (opted into tracking). See: [`/guides/how-to-start-tracking`](/guides/how-to-start-tracking)

### Competition Types
> *Note: Only the creator of a competition can add participants - it is not possible to view who this is.*

#### User-created Competitions
- Typically created for a group of friends who don't necessarily belong to the same group (clan) on the website.

#### Group-created Competitions
- Typically created by a group's leaders/admins and restricted to group members.

### How To Join

1. Ensure your profile exists and is up to date
   1. If you’ve never been tracked, see: [`/guides/how-to-start-tracking`](/guides/how-to-start-tracking)
   2. Consider requesting a fresh update so the host can validate your stats.
   
2. Find an active competition
   1. Browse [`https://wiseoldman.net/competitions`](https://wiseoldman.net/competitions) and filter by metric, status, and/or type.
   2. Open the competition page and read its description/rules for any listed contact info.

3. Contact the right person
   1. User-created competitions: Reach out where you discovered the competition (Discord, clan chat, forum post), provide your RuneScape name, and request to join.
   2. Group-created competitions: Contact a leader/admin of the hosting group (check the group’s page or posted socials) and ask to be added.

4. Get added by the host
   1. The host will add you manually. You’ll appear in the participant list when added.
   2. If team-based, specify which team you should join (if applicable).

### Ensuring Accurate Gains
> *In order for gains to be accurate, you must be ranked in the corresponding competiton metric.*

> *Using the Wise Old Man RuneLite plugin will help make sure you have the required **two** snapshots during the competition but you should always verify that the website has your expected competition values.*

1. Log out **AFTER** the competition has started.
2. Go to your player profile and click the `Update` button.
3. Log back in to the game
4. Log out **BEFORE** the competition has ended.
5. Go to your player profile and click the `Update` button.

### Tips
- Join early so organizers have time to add you before the start time.
- Keep your profile updated so organizers can verify your eligibility.
- For group competitions, joining the group may be required before being added to the competition.

### Troubleshooting
- Can’t find who to contact: For non-group competitions, the host is not listed on-site; look for contact info where the competition was announced.
- Not appearing on the page: You haven’t been added yet; confirm with the host/leader.
- Profile not found: Create your profile first by starting tracking.
